Implementation: I have created three personal web pages- bio.html, which
  contains my biography, resume.html, which contains my resume, and index.html,
  which is my home page and contains a mock-photo of myself and links to my
  bio and resume. I have created an index.html page in my CS account that
  redirects to this home page. I created one style sheet which contains a dozen
  styling rules. As far as I know, all have been correctly implemented.
