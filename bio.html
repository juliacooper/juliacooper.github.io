  <h1> Biography </h1>
  <p class = "Bio"> Julia Cooper was born on the extremely popular holiday
    known as flag day in the vibrant town of Providence, Rhode Island. From her
    very first day in the world, Julia had a full head of red hair. Julia's
    parents had met during their college years at Yale, and had settled down
    in Providence to work with students Brown University's Christian Fellowship.
    Julia's parents loved God. Julia had an older sister, Jamie, who was a year
    and a half older than her, and she would later have a second sister named
    Dylan when she was two years old. </p>
  <p class = "Bio"> Julia's childhood was comprised of
    several moves, from Providence to Columbus, Ohio, from Columbus to
    Vancouver, British Columbia, and from Vancouver back to Providence. Every
    time Julia's family moved, they drove their used car with a UHAUL truck
    attached holding all of their stuff. The cross-country car trips were very
    long, but the family got to see many amazing sights, such as
    the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, and Yellowstone. Vancouver was Julia's
    favorite home. Her school was a child's dream- there were two long recesses
    every day, a huge playground to play on, and the teachers kept their dogs in
    the classroom. The beach was in walking distance from the house Julia
    lived in, and she lived so near to her friends that she could just walk over
    to their houses anytime to play with them. </p>
    <p class = "Bio"> Alas, time was up in Vancouver, and
    Julia's family moved back to Providence. Julia finished elementary school
    and then started middle school there. Middle school was rough, as it is for
    every kid. But Julia made it through alive, and then entered high school,
    a much better environment. Julia joined the chorus and the track team and
    a literary club and the debate team, and went to a weekly youth group
    called Young Life, which was the best part of her week. In the middle of
    high school, Julia taught herself how to play the ukulele, as she had
    gotten rather tired of learning long piano pieces. Ever since she learned
    her first chords, Julia has had a secret dream of playing in a female
    bluegrass band, but she doubts that will ever happen. Julia's greatest
    uke accomplishment was playing in her church's worship band. </p>
    <p class = "Bio"> Julia finally
    graduated high school, and was relieved to be released from the confinement
    of school and to start a new life in Boston where no one knew her name.
    Julia got to Tufts and knew right away it was the place for her. She made
    best friends in the first week, and found a supportive Christian community,
    and life was simply good. Julia had no idea what to study, so she studied
    everything, from Spanish to English to Computer Science to Psychology to
    Geology. Studying everything was seeming to work for her, so she just kept
    doing that for four semesters, and then finally decided she should
    probably narrow it down to Computer Science and English. Julia is currently
    a Sophomore, and is very stressed out, but coping with God, tea, Mumford and
    Sons, and knitting. The end. </p>
